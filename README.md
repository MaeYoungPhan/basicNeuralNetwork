# Basic Neural Network
I'm facsinated with the capabilities and potential within the field of AI and Machine Learning.

I enjoy thinking about both the practical application and development, as well as, the psychological and ethical implications. Blame it on a life-long fascination with how the human mind works, building a mind for a computer seems dope.

To gain more practical knowledge, I'm seeking out foundational tutorials to code some simple models. This is one of the most basic ones I found. If you'd like to try it yourself, the link is below.
